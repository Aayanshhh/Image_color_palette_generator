# Color Palette Generator

This repository contains a Python script that generates a color palette from an image using k-means clustering. The user is prompted to select an image and specify the number of colors for the palette, and the script displays both the original image and the generated color palette. The palette can also be saved as a PNG file.

## Features

- Select an image file through a graphical user interface (GUI).
- Specify the number of colors for the palette (between 1 and 20).
- Display the original image alongside the generated color palette.
- Save the color palette as a PNG file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- opencv-python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- tk (Tkinter)
